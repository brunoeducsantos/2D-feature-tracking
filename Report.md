## Introduction
In this report, an analysis will be made to obtain the best image keypoints, descriptor generator and matcher. 
The keypoints generator used in this project are the following:
* HARRIS
* FAST 
* BRISK 
* ORB
* AKAZE
* SIFT
Regarding the descriptors, the analysis will be about the following ones:
* BRIEF
* ORB
* FREAK
* AKAZE 
* SIFT
Finally, the matchers used in this project are:
* FLANNBASED
* BRUTE FORCE pair matching

The performance analysis will be based on:
* time taken to compute keypoints and descriptors
* Number of points generated
* Number of matched KeyPoints ( i.e. true positive, false positive matches)

## Distribution of keypoints
